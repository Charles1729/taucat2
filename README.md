# Taucat
A Discord bot for some miscellaneous games that I haven't seen many bots implement.  No moderation commands, no "all-purpose" commands - this bot is intended for fun.  This bot was made some short amount of time after Eric Zhan's [Sigmacat](https://github.com/ricE06/sigmacat/tree/main) which why it's named Taucat.  Sigmacat (and I think his newer Omegacat) are really cool!  Check it out!

# Functionality
Taucat currently supports the following features:
- Reaper

# This Bot is a Work In Progress!
Features of the bot have not been completely fleshed out yet.  Some things I'd like to implement in the future are:
- Reaper: Some things need to be unspaghetti-ified and then some features need to be added.
- The Mind (game): A game in which a group of 4 people try to place down numbered cards in ascending order without any forms of explicit communication.  Been implemented before [here](https://themind.tetsis.com/), but I think a Discord version is extremely viable.
- Greed Control: From [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/greedcontrol).
- Fish: Also known as Literature, has [already been implemented by CJ Quines](https://cfish.herokuapp.com/), but I don't believe has been on Discord.
- Zero Rationality Mafia: I don't know if this is anywhere on the internet, so I can't link you something yet.  Although I did play this at SPARC 2024, and from what I can remember, it seems "not difficult" to implement into a Discord bot.  We'll have to see about that.
- Time Capsules: Messages people can store into the bot privately in DMs and people can dig up publicly in servers after 1 year has passed.

# I Want Some Thing Added To This Bot!
Contact me at charleszhang1729 (at) gmail (dot) com or DM me on Discord at contabulator (preferred), and I'll consider it.
